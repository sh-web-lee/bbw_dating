                                    online dating unless you have one of the best chubby dating apps — PlusCupid, a free BBW finder with an advanced matching algorithm.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p class="ani_right4">Such a rule, unlike many other BBW dating apps, seems to go against the concept of "fall in love", a romantic attitude that waits for love to come. Yet before falling, you must take a jump or a push, isn’t it? Therefore,
                                    PlusCupid comes up with this, in hope of encouraging you to express your love bravely.</p>

                                too. Once I sent a picture to someone and he screenshotted it before the photo was auto-deleted. PlusCupid notified me about that immediately, then I reported him with no mercy.</p>

                            <p>I like PlusCupid for the “Voice Signature”! It makes a person more real to me. I don’t just check someone’s profile for 2 seconds on PlusCupid. Instead, I stop to hear what they say. I feel attracted to some people even though
                                I don't have many feelings at first sight. Great job, PlusCupid. Looking forward to more designs like this.</p>

                            <p>I met my boyfriend on PlusCupid about 6 months ago. It all started with a simple “hello” he sent to me that night. We talked and talked on PlusCupid for 2 weeks, then we decided to have a date. Surprisingly, it turns out that
                                he is such a nice and considerate guy as he is on the BBW dating app. Thank you PlusCupid. I never felt so happy in my life.</p>

                            <p>I feel safe to chat and date with other curvy singles on PlusCupid. Most of them get 4 verified colorful tickets on their bio, so I know it can not be a fake profile or an identity theft. The "Instant Photo" is pretty cool,
                                too. Once I sent a picture to someone and he screenshotted it before the photo was auto-deleted. PlusCupid notified me about that immediately, then I reported him with no mercy.</p>
